# Quant-Learning-Log
Welcome to my journey into quantitative trading. I'm an incoming sophomore at Northwestern University building skills in math, programming, and trading strategy development. This repo will house projects, reflections, and experiments as I prepare for internships and a career in quant trading.

## 🧠 Goals
- Build strong fundamentals in probability, statistics, and algorithms
- Implement and backtest trading strategies in Python
- Prepare for quant interview puzzles and brainteasers
- Log progress weekly

## 📁 Structure
- `backtest_strategies/` – Python strategies
- `weekly_reflections/` – Journal-style notes
- `mental_math/` – Tricks and practice logs
