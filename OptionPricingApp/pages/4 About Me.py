Hi, I’m Takeshi, a student at Northwestern University (Class of 2028), from Newport Beach, California.  
I’m currently pursuing a degree in Data Science and Mathematics with a strong interest in quant finance and data analysis. 
I built this project during the summer before my sophomore year entirely from scratch as a way of combining my passions for and knowledge of options theory, stats/probability, and data analysis & visualization with Python.


If you enjoyed using this app, I’d love to hear your feedback and critiques (anything that can help me improve my coding and visualization skills). Please feel free to reach out! :)
