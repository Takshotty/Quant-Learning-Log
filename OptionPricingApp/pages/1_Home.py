This web app demonstrates two fundamental option pricing models: 
- The **Blackâ€“Scholes** Model
    - Calculates option prices using a formula based on stock price, time, volatility, and interest rates.
    - Best for European options that can only be exercised at expiration.
- The **Binomial Tree** Model
    - Estimates option prices by simulating step-by-step stock price movements in a tree.
    - Flexible for European and American options that can be exercised early.
